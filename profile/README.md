## Hi there 👋

If you have a repo you want to be listed on the lab's page, you have to transfer ownership to the hatlab organizaton- since you will be given admin access to the lab github page you will still retain all ownership access to the repository. This homepage is made public, but repositories can still be made private only to members of the organization.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
